				<h1>How to use VitaReminder</h1>
				
				<br/>
				
				<p>VitaReminder helps you to organize your supplements.  For the purposes of this program, 
				   a 'supplement' is any vitamin, medicine or nutritional supplement that you want to keep 
				   track of.
				</p>

				<p>You begin by adding a new 'regimen', and then you add supplements to that regimen.</p>
				
				<br/>
				
				<h3>Add a New Regimen</h3>
				
				<p>To add a new regimen, press the <img src="add_icon_20x20.png" alt="green plus button"/> 
				   button to the right of the regimens table, and enter a name for this regimen (for example, 
				   "My Workout Regimen").
				</p>
				
				<p>At any time, you can edit a regimen by selecting the regimen in the table and pressing the 
				   <img src="edit_icon_20x20.png" alt="pencil button"/> button.
				</p>

				<p>To delete a regimen, press the <img src="delete_icon_20x20.png" alt="red minus button"/> button 
				next to the regimens table.
				</p>
				
				<br/>

				<h3>Add Supplements to the Regimen</h3>

				<p>After you create a regimen, you can add supplements to it.</p>

				<p>To add a supplement, press the <img src="add_icon_20x20.png" alt="green plus button"/> button 
				   to the right of the supplements table and enter a name for this supplement.
				</p>

				<p>At any time, you can edit a supplement by selecting the supplement in the table and pressing 
				   the <img src="edit_icon_20x20.png" alt="pencil button"/> button.
				</p>

				<p>To delete a supplement, press the <img src="delete_icon_20x20.png" alt="red minus button"/> 
				   button next to the supplements table.
				</p>
				
				<br/>

				<h3>How to Set Reminders</h3>

				<p>When you add or edit a supplement, you will notice that the screen contains options to set 
				   e-mail, text message and automated voice reminders:
				</p>
				
				<p><img src="reminder_radio_buttons.png" alt="reminder radio buttons"/></p>
				
				<p>However, at this point all of the radio buttons are disabled.</p>

				<p>To enable reminders, you must first enable them in the "Configure Reminders" dialog.  You open 
				   this dialog by pressing the "Reminders" menu at the top of the screen, and then pressing 
				   "Configure Reminders":
				</p>

				<p><img src="configure_reminders.png" alt="configure reminders menu item"/></p>

				<br/>

				<h3>E-Mail Reminders</h3>

				<p>To enable e-mail reminders, select the check box next to "Enable e-mail reminders".</p>

				<p>Type in your e-mail address and then press the "Verify" button.  Check your e-mail inbox for your 
				   verification code, and then come back to the screen and enter your code.
				</p>

				<p>After verifying your e-mail address, you will be able to set e-mail reminders for any of
				   your supplements.  If you now press the <img src="edit_icon_20x20.png" alt="pencil button"/> 
				   button for any of your supplements, you will see that you can now set e-mail reminders to "On" 
				   or "Off":
				</p>

				<p><img src="email_radio_buttons.png" alt="email radio buttons"/></p>

				<p>To test it out, select the "On" button, and then enter a time in the near future:</p>
				
				<p><img src="time_combo_boxes.png" alt="time combo boxes"/></p>
				
				<p>Now press the Apply Changes button:</p>
				
				<p><img src="apply_changes_button.png" alt="apply changes button"/></p>

				<p>Then check your e-mail inbox at that time, and you should receive your e-mail reminder for 
				   that supplement.
				</p>
				
				<br/>

				<h3>Text Message and Automated Voice Reminders</h3>

				<p>In the same way, you can enable and set text message and automated voice reminders.</p>

				<p>First go back to the "Configure Reminders" dialog, but this time select the check box next 
				   to "Enable text-message reminders".
				</p>
				
				<p>Enter your phone number and press the "Verify" button.</p>
				
				<p>Shortly afterwards, you should receive a text message with your verification code.  Enter 
				   this code in the field provided.
				</p>

				<p>If you now press the <img src="edit_icon_20x20.png" alt="pencil button"/> button to the right 
				   of the supplements table, you will see that you can now set text message reminders for any of 
				   your supplements:
				</p>  

				<p><img src="text_radio_buttons.png" alt="text radio buttons"/></p>

				<p>To test it out, select the "On" button, and then enter a time in the near future.</p>
				
				<p>Press the Apply Changes button.</p>

				<p><i>Note: It may occasionally take a minute or two to receive your text message, depending on how 
				   busy the network is at the time.</i>
				</p>

				<p>To enable automated voice reminders, select the "Enable voice reminders" check box in the 
				   "Configure Reminders" dialog.
				</p>

				<p>If you have already verified your phone number, there is no need to verify it again.</p>

				<p>If you now press the <img src="edit_icon_20x20.png" alt="pencil button"/> button to the right 
				   of the supplements table, you will see that you can now set automated voice message reminders 
				   for any of your supplements:
				</p>  
				
				<p><img src="voice_radio_buttons.png" alt="voice radio buttons"/></p>
				
				<p>To test it out, select the "On" button, and then enter a time in the near future.</p>
				
				<p>Press the Apply Changes button.</p>

				<p><i>Note: It may occasionally take a minute or two to receive your voice message, depending on 
				   how busy the network is at the time.</i>
				</p>
				
				<br/>
				
				<h3>Backing up Your Data</h3>
				
				<p>The standard Save menu item and the Save button at the bottom of your screen will save your 
				   data to a database on your hard drive.
				</p>
				
				<p>If you would like to save your data to a file, you can use the Export function.</p>		
				
				<p>To do so, select the Export menu item under the File menu:</p>
				
				<p><img src="export_menu_item.png" alt="export menu item"/></p>
				
				<p>In the dialog that appears, browse to the location that you would like to save your file to and 
				   then press Save.
				</p>
				
				<p>You can also import this data at a later time.</p>
				
				<p>To do so, select the Import menu item under the File menu:</p>
				
				<p><img src="import_menu_item.png" alt="import menu item"/></p>
				
				<p>When you import new data, any of your current data that you are working with will be lost.</p>
				
				<p>As a result, when you attempt to import new data, you will be prompted to save your current data.</p>
				
				<br/>
				
				<h3>Export to Excel Spreadsheet</h3>
				
				<p>You can also export your data to an Excel spreadsheet.  The file that is created is in the Excel
				   2007 (.xlsx) format.
				</p>
				
				<p>To export your data to an Excel spreadsheet, select the following menu item:</p>
				
				<p><img src="excel_menu_item.png" alt="excel menu item"/></p>
				
				<p>In the dialog that appears, browse to the location that you would like to save your file to and 
				   then press Save.
